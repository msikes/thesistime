disclaimer: not really a fun list of fun

stuff to try to implement this weekend?

programming (none of this is required it would just be useful and would be a good direction to go in for the time being!!):
	1. interactive hotspot (collision i guess)
	2. dialogue that happens if interactive spot is hit
	4. dialogue with two choices that affect the answer
	
art:
	1. rough animatic for walk animation
	2. rough animatic for some sort of BG animation maybe a bird
	3. NPC drawing 
	4. object of some sort that is also interactive
	5. more levels :3
